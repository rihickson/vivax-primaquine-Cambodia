# Assessing a Primaquine intervention in Cambodia2020â€“2025: A modelling study

Project with CNM to model if Primaquine provided to all adult males (15 years and older) from October 2020 is likely be sufficient to reach elimination of vivax malaria by the current target date of 2025.

## Code

`cambodia`: is where the code specific to this scenario is kept.
	`Project`: is where all the Cambodia malaria data for calibration etc is found
	`Results`: is generated by running the code
	`run_all_cambodia.py` is what the user needs to run to general all results found in the paper.	

`malaria_utils`: is the base code developed by the Burnet Institute

`surveillance`: is the R code used to estimate the surveillance requirements to detect at least one case for the projected incidences.

`requirements.txt`: is the python package requirements to run the code. 


## Paper

`bmc_article.tex`: is the paper source file.

The rest are style files required by the journal.

## csvs

`cambodia_population_estimates.csv`: this is where population estimates used in the Data sheets found in `code/cambodia/Project/` are generated.

`aggregated_results.csv`: this is the output from `code/cambodia/result_aggregation.py`


## Figures

These are generated by the code.
