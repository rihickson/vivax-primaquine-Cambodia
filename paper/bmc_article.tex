\parttitle{Background} %the context and purpose of the study
Elimination targets for \textit{Plasmodium vivax} are approaching, with the Cambodian target 2025. Quantitative tools can help determine if proposed new strategies will be sufficient to meet those targets.

\parttitle{Methods} %how the study was performed and statistical tests used
We calibrated the Optima malaria transmission model reported case data from 2011--2018 for six Provinces with different transmission levels. The model had two human populations: with males 15 years plus, and everyone else. We used the calibrated model to explore for best and worst case interpretations of the available case data, and of the Primaquine intervention.

\parttitle{Results} %the main findings
We found elimination is unlikely to be reached in Provinces with fairly high burdens of \textit{Plasmodium vivax}, such as Pursat, by only targeting adult males with Primaquine. However, it will substantially reduce transmission. As such, we identify how many tests will need to be conducted to have 99\% confidence of detecting at least one case, given the lower incidence by 2025.

\parttitle{Conclusions}
A primaquine intervention targeting adult males is likely to have a substantial impact on transmission of \pv, though it is not likely to result in elimination from all Provinces by the 2025 target. The surveillance requirements to ensure the resulting lower incidence is detected as Cambodia approaches elimination may be infeasible, e.g. for Takeo, especially as all Provinces will see a decrease in case counts as the intervention is Nationwide.

%Background
%The Background section should explain the background to the study, its aims, a summary of the existing literature and why this study was necessary or its contribution to the field.
\section*{Background} 

\textit{Plasmodium vivax} (\pv) is the cause of a significant burden of malaria globally, with an estimated XX cases, XX deaths~\cite{WHOreport}. In Cambodia, it has been responsible for 30--80\% of cases in different Provinces, with the proportion increasing as the burden of \textit{Plasmodium falciparum} (\pf) has decreased~\cite{Pengby}.

The key difference between \pf~and \pv~is the hypnozoite stage of \pv, which results in relapses~\cite{biologyofvivax}. There are an estimated XX~hypnozoites formed from each infectious mosquito bite, though the biology and mechanisms are poorly understood~\cite{vivaxbiology}. Standard treatment for \pv~is Chloroquine (CQ) for a blood stage infection. Radical cures have been developed to clear the hypnozoite stage, using 8-Aminoquinolines~\cite{RicPrice}. Primaquine (PQ) has been approved/licenses for use in several countries, though the WHO recommendation is to test for G6PDd before administration~\cite{WHOguidelines}. 

Elimination targets for \pv~have been set for many countries~\cite{WHO}, and the Cambodian target is 2025~\cite{Cambodia}. Cambodia are currently trialling a 14-day low dose primaquine intervention for adult males in a couple of health centres in Pursat Province. If successful, this will be expanded into a National programme. We use transmission modelling to determine if this is likely to be sufficient to eliminate \pv~by the 2025 target. 

%Methods

\subsection*{Data synthesis to assess disease burden} 
Data on malaria incidence were obtained from the Cambodia National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM)~\ref{CNM_Pengby}. Population and mortality data were obtained from the Cambodia Bureau of Statistics~\ref{}. The aggregated data used for model calibration are provided in Additional file~\ref{supp}, and on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/rihickson/vivax-primaquine-Cambodia}. \todo[inline]{Make this repo public.} A number of data wrangling steps were conducted to produce the data the model was calibrated too. For example, some Provinces were combined to maintain static borders across the data period of 2011--2018. The population stratification for \pv~incidence was provided as a proportion of cases by age and sex, from 2015--2019. Therefore, data for each Province was pro-rated to achieve the correct proportion of cases for Males 15 years and older. 

\subsection*{Epidemic model}

The dynamic transmission model of \pv~is based on that by Scott~\etal~\cite{scott2017}. It accounts for transmission between humans and mosquitoes, with the conceptual disease progression in the model depicted in Fig~\ref{fig:model_flow}. People in the model are identified as: susceptible; infected with \pv~in the liver only (hypnozoites and/or active liver stage); infected with active blood stage infection able to infect mosquitoes (gametocytes present -- further divided into clinical, severe, or asymptomatic); or recovered and immune (with no hypnozoites). The recovered and immune compartment is important for capturing \pv~dynamics given our current understanding of the importance of immunity in reducing transmission or symptomatic infections~\cite{}\todo{fact check me}. The human population is stratified into males 15 years and older (M15+) and everyone else (Gen), to enable the primaquine intervention proposed in Cambodia to be captured by the model. Further details on the full model structure, parameter values, and calibration are provided in Additional file~\ref{supp} and on \url[Github]{https://github.com/rihickson/vivax-primaquine-Cambodia}.


\subsection*{Programmatic response considered}
For the sake of $<$fancy word meaning simplicity of model design$>$, the only explicit programmatic response considered is the primaquine intervention. The effect of all other interventions are considered to be captured by the model calibration (see \S~\ref{sec:calibration}).

The PQ programmatic response is considered to have four key parameters: start date (October 2020), coverage ($c$), G6PD RDT sensitivity ($G$)\todo{though this is actually more like the proportion of the population who are G6PD>0.7 atm, and hence eligible for PQ}, and the effectiveness of PQ in terms of hypnozoite removal ($E$: a combination of efficacy and adherence). The PQ scenario has, from the start date, $(1-c)(1-G)(1-E)$ times the proportion of the population successfully completing treatments not clearing hypnozoites. The baseline scenario has no PQ, and a default value of $0.75$ of the population not clearing hypnozoites on successful treatment completion. To determine if elimination of \pv~is possible by the target date, we consider the case where there is 1.0 coverage, no G6PD deficiency (1.0 of the population are eligible for PQ), and 1.0 effectiveness of PQ, meaning after treatment there are no M15+ with hypnozoites. This is beyond a ``best case scenario'', as these numbers are not achievable. Hence, if \pv~is still present in 2025 in the model predictions, this additional intervention alone will not be sufficient.  

\subsection*{Model calibration} \label{sec:calibration} % and validation 

Data on annual incidence (2011--2018), testing numbers, and demographics were used to calibrate the model for each population stratification and Province (see Additional file~\ref{supp}: Figures~\ref{}--\ref{}). 

The population size was modelled in each Province by group, including transitions from the general population (Gen) to adult males (M15+). The population model (births, deaths, and transitions) was calibrated to fit the known demographics of each Province. I.e. estimated population size, known age and gender breakdown, and expected national lifespan.

The incidence data was divided into 6 clusters by positive \pv~test results in 2018, and a Province was chosen at random from each cluster. Provinces where the borders had changed during 2011--2018 were excluded from being chosen. Except that Pursat was not randomly selected but deliberately chosen, since this is where the trials are currently being conducted. The other five Provinces considered are: Mondul Kiri, Kampong Chhnang, Battambang, Pailin, and Takeo. 

The model was calibrated to the incidence and test data using parameters for the relative susceptibility of the population group to malaria infection; the probability of developing malaria-like symptoms for each person in a given year; the daily probability of testing for people with non-severe malaria-like symptoms such as fever; the daily probability of testing for people with severe malaria-like symptoms; the duration of the latent period (i.e. until hypnozoite reactivation); the proportion incompletely clearing hypnozoites after naturally recovering; and the proportion of new malaria cases that are asymptomatic (see Additional file~\ref{supp}: Table~\ref{calibrated_params}). To allow for changes in the surveillance system in Cambodia (see, for example, \cite{Pengby}), and changes in the other interventions through time, we calibrated to a ``best case'' and ``worst case'' baseline incidence scenario. The ``worst case'' is for the true incidence to be around the higher values of the data and increasing, and the ``best case'' is for the true incidence to be around the lower values of the data and decreasing. The true values are likely inbetween, but this enables us to capture the extreme ends. Uncertainty bounds on the model prediction were generated by sampling $\pm10\%$ of the calibrated parameter values for 30 iterations, and represent 75\% of the subsequent range.

 

%\subsection*{Sensitivity analysis} % maybe not? uncertainty band, sure. But not in reported results for prediction of elimination?

\subsection*{Surveillance}
Given the expected substantial impact on transmission from providing PQ to M15+, we use a negative binomial to estimate how many tests would need to be conducted to be 0.99 confident of detecting at least one case, assuming 100\% sensitivity and specificity of the tests. We also use a binomial to identify the probability of detecting at least one case (assuming 100\% sensitivity and specificity) as the number of tests conducted changes, for the predicted incidence of \pv~in 2020 and 2025. The difference in particular is then indicative of considerations that will need to be given to existing surveillance to be confident that elimination has been reached.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Model calibration}
For each of the 6 Provinces, calibrations such as that shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pursat-calibratoon} for Pursat were conducted. The left column (A and C) represent the ``General'' population group, and the right column (B and D) the ``Males 15 years and older'' group. The top row (A and B) represent the ``worst case'' baseline incidence calibration, where the model is calibrated to the higher data values and is increasing trend after 2018. The bottom row (C and D) represent the ``best case'', where the model is calibrated to the lower values and has a decreasing trend. The other 5 Figures depicting the calibration are shown in Additional File~\ref{supp}, Fig~\ref{fig:calibration_start}--\ref{fig:calibration_end}.

\subsection*{Primaquine impact on burden of disease in Cambodia}

The impact of Primaquine being provided to all Males 15 years and older from October 2020, will complete effectiveness, are shown for each Province and baseline incidence scenario in Figures~\ref{}--\ref{}. The ``vivax infection'' is an amalgamation of the exposed, uncomplicated, and severe malaria states, and ``latent'' refers to those with hypnozoites. The breakdown by state is shown in Additional file~\ref{supp}, Figures~\ref{}--\ref{}. Figures~\ref{}--\ref{} show PQ provided to M15+ is predicted to have a substantial impact on transmission. However, elimination of \pv~is not reached by 2025 for any of Provinces with the high and increasing baseline incidence, and is not reached even for the low and decreasing baseline incidence for the Provinces with a higher current burden (Pursat).
