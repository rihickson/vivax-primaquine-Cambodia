%Results: the main findings
%Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications
%Trial registration: If your article reports the results of a health care intervention on human participants, it must be registered in an appropriate registry and the registration number and date of registration should be in stated in this section. If it was not registered prospectively (before enrollment of the first participant), you should include the words 'retrospectively registered'.

\parttitle{Background} %the context and purpose of the study
Elimination targets for \textit{Plasmodium vivax} are approaching, with the Cambodian target 2025. Quantitative tools can help determine if proposed new strategies will be sufficient to meet those targets.

\parttitle{Methods} %how the study was performed and statistical tests used
We calibrated the Optima malaria transmission model reported case data from 2011--2018 for six Provinces with different transmission levels. The model had two human populations: with males 15 years plus, and everyone else. We used the calibrated model to explore for best and worst case interpretations of the available case data, and of the Primaquine intervention.

\parttitle{Results} %the main findings
We found elimination is unlikely to be reached in Provinces with fairly high burdens of \textit{Plasmodium vivax}, such as Pursat, by only targeting adult males with Primaquine. However, it will substantially reduce transmission. As such, we identify how many tests will need to be conducted to have 99\% confidence of detecting at least one case, given the lower incidence by 2025.

\parttitle{Conclusions}
A primaquine intervention targeting adult males is likely to have a substantial impact on transmission of \pv, though it is not likely to result in elimination from all Provinces by the 2025 target. The surveillance requirements to ensure the resulting lower incidence is detected as Cambodia approaches elimination may be infeasible, e.g. for Takeo, especially as all Provinces will see a decrease in case counts as the intervention is Nationwide.

%Background
%The Background section should explain the background to the study, its aims, a summary of the existing literature and why this study was necessary or its contribution to the field.
\section*{Background} 


Elimination targets for \textit{Plasmodium vivax} (\pv) are approaching, with the Cambodian target 2025. Quantitative tools can help determine if proposed new strategies will be sufficient to meet those targets.

%Methods
%The methods section should include:
%
%the aim, design and setting of the study
%the characteristics of participants or description of materials
%a clear description of all processes, interventions and comparisons. Generic drug names should generally be used. When proprietary brands are used in research, include the brand names in parentheses
%the type of statistical analysis used, including a power calculation if appropriate
\section*{Methods} \label{sec:methods} %Subsections are currently modelled on Scott et al. 2017

\subsection*{Data synthesis to assess disease burden} 

\subsection*{Epidemic model}

\subsection*{Programmatic response considered}

\subsection*{Model calibration} % and validation 

\subsection*{Sensitivity analysis} % maybe not? uncertainty band, sure. But not in reported results for prediction of elimination?

%Results
%This should include the findings of the study including, if appropriate, results of statistical analysis which must be included either in the text or as tables and figures.
\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Current burden of disease in Cambodia}

\subsection*{Model calibration and validation}

\subsection*{Primaquine impact on burden of disease in Cambodia}

%Discussion
%This section should discuss the implications of the findings in context of existing research and highlight limitations of the study.
\section*{Discussion}

%Conclusions
%This should state clearly the main conclusions and provide an explanation of the importance and relevance of the study reported.
\section*{Conclusions}

%List of abbreviations
%If abbreviations are used in the text they should be defined in the text at first use, and a list of abbreviations should be provided.
